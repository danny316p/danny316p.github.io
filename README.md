This repository is for a github pages website accessible at: http://danny316p.github.io/

My previous attempt at a github pages section never really worked out. I'm currently playing around with this (locally on a laptop) to get something that actually looks decent and is somewhat functional.

This one is based on Jekyll-Bootstrap (https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap), because you have to start somewhere and that seems like the best fit for GitHub pages.
